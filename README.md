# Aylos9er | Zero-Py Tesseract

## Description
Aylos9er is a 3D simulation application that visualizes a modified version of Conway's Game of Life using Three.js. Users can interact with the simulation by sending commands through a chat interface, creating bridges, and deforming a mesh.

## Features
- **3D Visualization**: Supports voxel grids, sphere swarms, and relational meshes.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Send commands to control the simulation.
- **Bridge Creation**: Connect cells with hyper lane bridges.
- **Mesh Deformation**: Create ripples in the mesh by clicking.

## Technologies Used
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D rendering.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
- JavaScript for application logic.
